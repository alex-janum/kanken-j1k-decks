# 漢字検定 準1級 問題集
*Downloads may also be found in the shared decks section on [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/499990065). Feel free to leave a thumbs up there if you've found these decks useful!*

This is a collection of decks made to help with practicing for the different sections of the Kanji Kentei Jun-1-Kyuu (officially *The Japan Kanji Aptitude Test Grade Semi-1*). They contain handmade practice questions based on words that have appeared on past tests between 2007 and 2022. Each deck comes pre-sorted so that words that have appeared multiple times on that section will be shown first.

The cards are designed to mimic the layout and the vertical writing on the actual exam, with only the necessary information shown on the front and back of each card in order to facilitate quick reviews with minimal distractions.

**Tapping anywhere on the back of the card** will bring up additional notes, including a full list of readings for each kanji, as well as definitions, translations, mnemonics, pictures, and fun facts wherever applicable.

However, this won't work if you're using the built-in whiteboard in AnkiDroid for reviews, since this overrides the ability to interact with the card itself. In this case, you can map the shortcut **User Action 1** to any button or gesture on your device to bring up this information from the back of the card instead.

## A Note on Character Forms
The Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation considers the Kangxi Dictionary (康熙字典) to be the authority on proper character forms (正字体) for kanji outside the *jōyō* and *jinmeiyō* lists. These flashcards follow that convention, and if you have the standard web font **Noto Serif JP** installed on your device already, these proper forms should be displayed by default.

There are a few instances where these forms differ from the ones that are more commonly used in modern Japanese writing. Some of the more notable cases include:
- 摑む typically being simplified to 掴む.
- 蠟燭 typically being simplified to 蝋燭.
- 竪子 often being written as 豎子, using the traditional Chinese spelling.

These are considered valid variant forms (異体字), and you don't get deducted points for using them on the actual exam, though they don't show up on the official answer sheets.

There are even more valid variant forms that arise from minor differences in stroke order, and traditional forms (旧字体) are allowed as well. I'd like to include these as extra information in a future update once I've figured out a good way to present them without ruining the compact layout, but for now only the proper character forms are shown on the cards.

In the meantime, please refer to the official 『漢検要覧 1／準1級対応』 as a reference for which alternate forms are valid to use if you're unsure.

## Other Kanji Kentei Levels
Kanji Kentei Jun-1-Kyuu (準1級) tests your knowledge on about 3,000 kanji from a list that mostly corresponds to the *JIS X 0208* (JIS第1水準) block incorporated in the Unicode standard, as well as on non-standard readings (表外読み・熟字訓・当て字) for the standard *jōyō* kanji. It is, in a sense, a stepping stone to the infamous 1-Kyuu (1級), which I am currently studying for myself and working on even more flashcards for. I'll be sharing those when they're ready, but in the meantime I'd recommend anyone interested in that level to check out some of these other great resources.
